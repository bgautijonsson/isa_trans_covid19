This github repo is a companion to the article *A hierarchical Bayesian implementation of a novel inverted generalized logistic growth curve for predicting diagnosed COVID-19 cases in 68 countries.*

---

The file `Make_Past_Models.R` is used to train the inverted generalized logistic growth model *(IGLGM)*.

The files `Analyze_Past_Models.R`, `Convergence_Info.R`, `Predict_Past_Models.R` and `Render_Summary_Document.R` can be used to process model results after fitting.

There is also a shiny app in `Past Models/Results/Model Checking/Interactive_Model_Checking.Rmd` for interactive model checking and prediction.
